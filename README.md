## Hate Speech Detection Setup

### Requirements to run the application:

- have a locally running instance of ollama
- or have it runnning in colab with the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oSSNt6Osme6FRXpRy9wTRKi2t433EQXB?usp=sharing


- have pulled the ```dolphin-mistral:7b-v2.6-dpo-laser-q5_1``` on that instance (or pull through the ui later)


Then you can either
- start the server as written below or
- use the app directly via https://hatespeech-detector.vercel.app/

### Troubleshooting
If you get a connection error, this is probably because you didn't connect the ollama instance properly
- check if the ollama instance is running
- check the console of the browser for detailed errors
- make sure the correct model is pulled on the ollama instance (and finished. The model is a few GB in size)
- pulling through the ui seems to sometimes have issues, ideally pull the model directly with ```ollama pull [modelname]```
- you might have to run ```ollama serve``` to expose the api
